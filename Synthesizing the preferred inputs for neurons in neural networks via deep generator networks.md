# Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks
This work aims to analyzing the activation of DNN. The previous work searches in the image space(RGB) and
tries to maximize the activation in the last layer. The network is fixed and we just optimize the input image, 
making it maximizing the activation. This kind of method is called **"activation maximization"**.   
A main problem is that the result image seems to be nosense to human beings. This paper aims at generating realistic 
image and maximize the activation, called DGN-AM.
