# Generalizing Skills with Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning
by Chelsea Finn, Tianhe Yu, Justin Fu, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine

## Overview

This work formulates a new task called "**semi-supervised** reinforcement learning", where we can use some label data from the reward function and then use the other unlabelled data to generalize the agent's knowledge without the the reward function.    
Here's the illustration:

In lifelong learning, we may not access the reward function all the time, but we still want to use these unlabelled data to generalize the performance. So can we train an agent that can generalize itself from unlabelled data?
