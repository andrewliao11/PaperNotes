# Controllable Text Generation
The author aims to generating plausible sentence using vae with **holistic** attribute discriminator. The main 
difficulties is that sentence generation usually suffer from non-differentiability problem (some papers attempt 
to use sample-based method like ref.3). Another challeng is that previous work focus on generating sentences with 
random semantic while the author uses vae with little supervision to learn distengled feature.
